 # Type Erasure
 
 When you are dealing with protocols that either have a Self requirement or an associated type, you cannot use the protocol name as a standalone type anymore.
 
 ## Type Erasure to the rescue!
 
 In programming languages, type erasure refers to the load-time process by which explicit type annotations are removed from a program, before it is executed at run-time.
