## The Algebra of Data Types

> “Types defined using enumerations and structs are sometimes referred to as algebraic data types, because they have this algebraic structure, similar to natural numbers” - Excerpt From: Chris Eidhof. “Functional Swift.” Apple Books.

>  We can calculate the states of a Type as the combination of its values. Enumerations are often referred to as sum types and structs as product types.
