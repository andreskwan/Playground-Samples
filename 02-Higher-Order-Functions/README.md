 # Higher-order functions
 
 ### In mathematics and computer science, a higher-order function is a function that does at least one of the following:
 - Takes one or more functions as arguments (i.e. procedural parameters)
 
 `(A -> B) -> C`
 - Returns a function as its result.
 
 `(A) -> ((B) -> C)`

 All other functions are first-order functions.
