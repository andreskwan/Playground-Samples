## Codable

> The Swift standard library defines a standardized approach to data encoding and decoding. You adopt this approach by implementing the Encodable and Decodable protocols on your custom types. Adopting these protocols lets implementations of the Encoder and Decoder protocols take your data and encode or decode it to and from an external representation such as JSON or property list. To support both encoding and decoding, declare conformance to Codable, which combines the Encodable and Decodable protocols. This process is known as making your types codable.
