## ViewController Composition

> Container view controllers are a way to combine the content from multiple view controllers into a single user interface. Container view controllers are most often used to facilitate navigation and to create new user interface types based on existing content. Examples of container view controllers in UIKit include UINavigationController, UITabBarController, and UISplitViewController, all of which facilitate navigation between different parts of your user interface.
