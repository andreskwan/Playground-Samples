 # A Playground for ilustrating The Interface Segregation Principle

 This principle deals with the disadvantages of “fat” or “polluted” interfaces.

 Classes that have “fat” interfaces are classes whose interfaces are not cohesive, that has to many member functions and can be broken up into groups. Each group serves a different set of clients.

 The ISP acknowledges that there are objects that require non-cohesive interfaces; however it suggests that clients should not know about them as a single class. Instead, clients should know about abstract base classes that have cohesive interfaces. Some languages refer to these abstract base classes as “interfaces”, “protocols” or “signatures”.
